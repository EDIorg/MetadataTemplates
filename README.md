# EDI metadata template

Use this template to provide EDI with metadata for your dataset. When completed send the template and your dataset to us. We will then translate your metadata to EML and upload it with your dataset to [the PASTA data repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp). Once archived, we'll send you the unique DOI and URL for your data package!
