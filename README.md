# EDI metadata template

This directory contains a metadata template (EDI_metadata_template.docx) used by EDI's data curation team to collect valuable information about a data provider's dataset. This information is then translated by the data curation team into the structured Ecological Metadata Language (EML) expected by the [EDI data repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp).

Before using this template please contact EDI (info@environmentaldatainitiative.org) to ensure your data can be archived in the data repository.
